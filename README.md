In the **Scroll project**, we will focus on implementing features related to scrolling behavior on a webpage. This project is expected to be a bit tedious due to various setups and functionalities, so attention to detail is crucial.

### Project Highlights:
1. **Scroll Event Handling**:
   - The primary aim is to work with the scroll event to dynamically modify the navbar. 
   - The navbar will switch from static to fixed as the user scrolls past a certain pixel threshold.

2. **Smooth Scrolling**:
   - Implement smooth scrolling behavior for navigating to different sections of the page, such as "About," "Services," or "Tour."

3. **Dynamic Date Display**:
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically set the current year in the footer instead of hardcoding it.

4. **Back to Top Button**:
   - Create a button that appears after scrolling a certain distance. Clicking this button will smoothly scroll the user back to the top of the page.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Address different setups for large screens and small screens, including a dynamic navbar link setup that adapts based on the navbar size.

6. **Complexity Management**:
   - Expect multiple configurations to handle various scenarios, such as whether the navbar is fixed or responsive, which will add to the complexity of the project.
